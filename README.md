This repository contains the script that was used to explore the Kaggle data sets and have an attemt of price predictions.

#### Packages used in this project:
 * pandas
 * numpy 
 * os
 * zipfile 
 * seaborn
 * matplotlib
 * sklearn
 
#### Repository content
________________________
* airbnb.ipynb: Notebook containing the exploratory and explanatory analyses of the data sets. The notebook uses CRSP-DM process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining).
* boston.zip: Contains zip files about Boston Airbnb.

#### Findings
_____________
* The pricing is very different in Boston compared to Seattle.
* In Boston small size rentals are much more expencives, whereas Seattle is more expensive for large group gatherings.
* Seattle high season is in the summer, and Boston has a peak in April for the marathon runners and in the fall as  it is the most beautiful time in the area.
* Most valuable predictors of the price are number of beds, room type, cancellation policy and some other features related to guest counts.


#### Conclusion
_______________
* Both data sets show clear differences between the pricing, seasonality and types of travel.
* Unlocking the reasons behind the prices and being able to predict them might be more challenging than it seems at first. The keys to success are domain knowledge and cleansed data.
